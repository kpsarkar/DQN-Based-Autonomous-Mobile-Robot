# DQN-Based-Autonomous-Navigation-Mobile-Robot
The project showcases how Deep Q-Networks can be utilized for Reinforcement Learning of a Mobile Agent/ Robot to carry out Autonomos Navigation. The project in implemented in python for WeBots Simulation Environment using e-Puck Robot. The project also provides codes than can be implemented on a physical robot (Fire Bird V with Raspberry Pi).
